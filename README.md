# NoCrowd

A multi-faceted website that will help regulate the crowdflow in IITH. As proof of concept, this version allows users to remotely order and pay for food from the canteen as well as check the status of the crowdflow in the badminton court.

## Setup

1. Run the DB with `docker-compose up -d`.
2. Run the client with `cd client && npm i && npm start`.
3. Run the server with `cd server && npm i && node index.js`.
